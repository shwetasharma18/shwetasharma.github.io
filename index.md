I am pursuing BA(English honors) from Delhi University, New Delhi and training in software development
at Navgurukul. I am really passionate about learning not only new but different things. I want to help
people in my surroundings with the help of my coding skills and always stay connected with the society. I
want to pay forward to Navgurukul so that other girls like me can also be part of this amazing program.

**The academic period spent in NavGurukul so far     -       11 months**

## Projects:
- ### Hangman Basic Game ([code](https://github.com/shwetasharma18/Hangman))
##### Implemented a guessing game in which the user has to guess a word. In the game, a user knows about some hints like how     many characters are in the word and also can ask for a hint to a character. I have used python in this project.
- ### API-Request-project ([code](https://github.com/shwetasharma18/Request-in-python))
##### In this project, I worked with the API of an e-learning platform to fetch a course by its id using python and then      fetch multiple or specific exercises by id.
- ### Basic Sorting and Searching Methods([code](https://github.com/shwetasharma18/searching-and-sorting-techniques))
##### Here I implemented some basic sorting and searching techniques to get clarity about the time complexity while writing our code.

## Experience:
- ### Facility Maintenance:  
##### I played the role of Facility MaintenanceCoordinator. I learnt how to manage things at the place we are living. During this period I learnt about how to work in a team and how to lead a team without hierarchies. I learnt about digital literacyand helped the community to become aware of applications such as IRCTC, Bigbasket, Practo and banking and e-commerce applications.
- ### Jail University Project: 
##### In this project we worked with jail inmates in Udaipur Central Jail , with the project leader Mr. Manish Jain. The idea of the project was to inculcate good values in the jail inmates and making them acquire skills such as coding, designing , performing music and arts. I worked with female inmates as a cultural coordinator. My role was to talkwith the women, arrange cultural activities there and involve them in suchactivities so that their mental state will not lead to depression. During this time I also learnt many dance styles, painting techniques and communication skills.
- ### Admissions team member: 
##### I interviewed candidates for Navgurukul 2018-19 and 2019-20 batch and reached out to more than 50 NGO partners to mobilize candidates for Navgurukul. I am Incharge of the Tuition group in which we guide those students who failed in logical interview to prepare and reappear.
